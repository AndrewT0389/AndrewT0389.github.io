     <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>I've lived in Los Angeles my entire life. Back in middle school, I took lessons in tae kwon do and really enjoyed my time. Unforeseen events (the pandemic) made me stop taking lessons. In high school, I participated in my school's leadership program, where I would have to help prepare for events and inform homerooms about upcoming events.</p>

     <h3>Interests</h3>
     <p>I am a current student at <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/">Occidental College</a>. While at Occidental, I plan to major in computer science and possibly something else with psychology, either a double major or minor (if the minor comes back). I first got into computer science in middle school. Seeing the code I wrote come to life and actually do something seemed interesting, and I explored this interest in high school. I was also fortunate to have a psychology teacher who made the subject interesting, and I would like to learn more about the field while at Occidental.</p>

     <h3>Hobbies</h3>
     <p>In my spare time, I like to go on walks, run, play chess, play video games, or make clothes for this "toy" of mine. </p>
